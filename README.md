# Hate-speech-detection
The rapid growth of social media and digital communication platforms has brought
opportunities for global interaction. However, it has also led to the spread of hate
speech. Hate speech includes offensive language targeting individuals or groups based
on attributes such as race, gender, or sexual orientation. Detecting hate speech is a
critical step toward creating safer digital spaces.
This report focuses on the development of machine learning models for hate speech
detection as a multilabel classification task. The goal is to predict five categories of
hate speech—NotHate, Racist, Sexist, Homophobe, and OtherHate—using a dataset of
tweets.
