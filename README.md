# Hate-speech-detection
Hate speech detection is critical for applications like controversial event extraction,
building AI chatterbots, content recommendation, and sentiment analysis. The goal
of the project is to create models for classifying text contents as offensive. This study
focuses on a multilabel classification problem, addressing five categories of hate speech:
NotHate, Racist, Sexist, Homophobe, and OtherHate
